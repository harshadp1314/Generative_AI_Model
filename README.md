# Generative_AI_Model


This project provides a Generative AI Model created from the Gutenberg Corpus and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model. The model was trained on a corpus of over 30,000 books from the Gutenberg Project, resulting in a text generator that can create unique and coherent passages of text based on the input.

The model was trained using a sequence-to-sequence approach, with the LSTM model performing the encoding of the input sequence and the decoder generating the output sequence. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with and a batch size of 256.

The model has been tested against a validation set and has achieved a perplexity score of 28. Additionally, the model has been tested against a qualitative test, with the generated passages being found to be both unique and coherent.

This Generative AI Model is a powerful tool for text generation and can be used to create passages of text that are both unique and coherent. The model is open source and can be freely downloaded and used for any purpose.
